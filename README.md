# GitHub

## GitHub Desktop

GitHub makes it easier for you to be a developer. There are more than 40 million users across the globe. When pursuing a career in programming, recruiters will certainly look at your GitHub page. We will be using GitHub Desktop in this class for version control.

## Markdown

> Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.

This document is written using markdown. It is a quick and easy way to style text. We will use markdown in every project in this class so get used to it!

There are a few projects to get you started using GitHub and Markdown in the [GitHub](/GitHub/) folder.

# HTML and CSS

You will use HTML and CSS to make webpages in this class. HTML is similar to Markdown language but more robust. You will make simple webpages with HTML and CSS.

There are a few projects to get you started using HTML and CSS in the [HTML CSS](/HTML_CSS/) folder.
